# FinalProject

Open the file prototype.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Make sure the two .csv data files are uploaded in the same file directory (this is mock data randomly generated by Mockaroo). Run the file and view the prototype visualization.

Download app.py and all .csv files, making sure they are in the same file. In your terminal, navigate to the folder with the files and run the command streamlit run app.py.

Alternatively, the visualization can be accessed here: https://visualizationredesign-az3nrfsd589rbvs8djehyb.streamlit.app/
